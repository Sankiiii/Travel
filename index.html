           <p id="para"> Ladakh can be the dream bike riding destination in India. Blessed with such mesmerizing beauty this region of Jammu & Kashmir state is a challenge that any crazy-adventurous bike rider would like to take. The trail being rugged, the weather being rough and unpredictable and cherry on top the continuous risk of landslides and other hazards keep the riders on their toes. Ladakh is the land of beautiful lakes, high mountain passes, Buddhist monasteries and meandering roads that are mostly unpaved. Therefore while planning a ride here, one is spoilt for choices but what you must know that you can never make a bad choice as each trail has its perks and thrills.</p>

           <p id="para"> South India has some breathtaking biking routes and one of its best examples would be Valparai to Vazhachal Forest. An ideal bike ride on this route would be during the monsoon season. The route connects Pollachi in Tamil Nadu to Chalakudy in Kerala, which is prominently covered with fine tropical rainforests and cloud and evergreen forests. The trail passes through stunning waterfalls and numerous dams and reservoirs. And since this area is either part of the Anamalai tiger reserve or the Vazhachal forest reserve, wildlife sightings makes a significant part of it. Well-maintained roads and the emerald beauty of forests are the highlights that can surely allure bike riders here.</p>
